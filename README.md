 * Authentication is meant for the identification of users and provision of access rights and contents depending on their id.
 * It is an essential part of web development that we can't afford to undermine its security.
 * The authentication system is one that allows a user to access a resource only after supplied credentials are compared with that stored in the database and found to be the same.
 * Authentication is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. 
 * If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access.
