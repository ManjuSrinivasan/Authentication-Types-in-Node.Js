# Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

    * Service-oriented architecture (SOA): an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network.
    * In Simple words, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a solution for making two applications communicate with each other by a collection of services. 
    * A service is self-independent, does not depend on the language, on which the consumer application is written. 
    * This is how the concept of the Service Oriented Architecture revolves, the consumer application will send the request to the service provider and in return, the response will be received by the consumer. 
    * The connections between the service provider and the service consumer will be done through the web services, which transfers the request and responding with that the data which is being requested.
